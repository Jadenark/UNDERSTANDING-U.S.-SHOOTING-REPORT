UNDERSTANDING U.S. SHOOTINGS INCIDENTS REPORT

This report offers a comprehensive analysis of police shooting incidents across the United States, with a focus on the demographic characteristics of victims, including age, gender, race, etc., as well as threat levels and the involvement of weapons in these encounters. It aims to highlight the dynamics of police use of force and brutality, and its effects on various communities.
The data is categorized by key variables such as race, gender, armed status, and threat level, with threat levels further categorized into "Attacked," "Other," and "Undetermined." 
Additionally, the report examines the relationship between the type of weapon (if any) involved and the perceived threat level during the incident. This analysis aims to provide insights into how various factors may influence the outcomes of police-civilian encounters, especially in cases leading to the use of brutality and force.
The aim of this analysis is to offer a data-driven perspective on police shootings, law enforcement practices and safety as a whole.
My data analysis seeks to answer the following question;

•	What is the gender distribution of the victims?

•	What are the racial backgrounds of the victims?

•	What is the racial breakdown of victims in police shootings?

•	 What are the percentage manner of death of victims?

•	What years does the shooting cover?

TOTAL NUMBER OF VICTIMS BY GENDER AND RACE

The total number of female victims was 222, with 126 of them being white, 47 Blacks, 26 Hispanic, 4 Asians and 4 others. 
 
The number of victims that were males were a total of 4673 with 2340 being Whites, 1251 Blacks, 876 Hispanic, 89 Asians, 73 Natives and 44 others.

 
In the analysis, it can be seen that men are more involved in the police brutality. This is because men are more often targeted by police violence because they are more likely to be in risky or confrontational situations. The police also see men as more threatening than women, which can lead to more aggressive responses.
 Also, men often engage in behaviors that increase their chances of interacting with law enforcement. This is why there are more cases of police brutality involving men than there are women. 
Also, in the analysis, it is noted that the whites are more involved in police brutality and this is due to their larger share of the population in certain areas, followed by the blacks.
